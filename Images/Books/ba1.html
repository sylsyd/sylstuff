    I was born just after the first Summer of Love in the very room in which my
    father died thirty-eight years later. It was my parents’ bedroom. She was a
    would-be painter who made money sewing underpriced dresses for local,
    well-heeled but parsimonious ladies, and he was a postman at the time, later
    to become a swimming pool attendant, ice-cream man, window cleaner and
    eventually a taxi driver. Theirs was a world of lino and pregnancy tests,
    hired furniture and rent collectors; a country mile from the swinging sixties
    Carnaby Street cliché, and more akin to the joyless grey of post-war Britain
    than the popular Technicolor myth. The room was in one of those poky,
    claustrophobic, low-rise council houses – you know the type; they pepper
    the tatty parts of suburbia and the nation’s drab dormitory towns, cramped
    and pebble-dashed, exiled to the outskirts, ignored and forever driven by.
    Ours was the house right at the edge of the estate in a place called
    Lindfield, a village perched just outside and swallowed up by Haywards
    Heath; an anonymous commuter town, a drab, dreary little train stop
    somewhere between London and Brighton. It was a place where, beyond
    the torrid kitchen-sink dramas of everyday lower-middle-class life, nothing
    ever really happened and probably nothing ever really will.
    My parents chose the house because they thought it would be nice to
    raise their kids next to a wood, as indeed it was but a few yards away
    beyond a graffitied, corrugated iron fence, and sat like a threat at the bottom
    of the concrete road was the local tip. At the weekend people would turn up
    to throw away their broken appliances and household detritus. It was a sea
    of rust and white enamel, a tangle of discarded furniture and springs and
    perished tyres and dried-up paint pots. To the local kids it was, of course, a
    wonderful and frightening playground, a source of constant fascination and
    danger. We would clamber over the rubble and mess around with the
    smashed-up mopeds and seized-up bicycle chains, unaware of the lurking
    dangers as we played in the skips with mercury from broken thermometers.
    Once, a small scuppered rowing boat appeared and became the centrepiece
    of our fevered games for a whole summer, until it was eventually
    vandalised and left to the cruel entropy of the elements. The area is a nature
    reserve now, and I sometimes wonder if the dog walkers and picnicking
    ramblers know about the rusting graveyard beneath their Wellingtoned feet.
    The house was small. Very small. Before my father died, I would return
    there for dutiful Christmas visits and would always be shocked by its
    almost toy-like scale. I had a sister, too, the lovely Blandine, named after
    the daughter of the Romantic Hungarian composer Franz Liszt. My dad,
    Peter, had named my sister, so it was thankfully left up to Sandra, my mum,
    to name me. For this I’m eternally grateful, as due to either coincidence or
    judgement I was born on the very date of Horatio Nelson’s birthday, one of
    my father’s heroes and a key member of his ‘Big Three’ – an exclusive
    private club of idols that also housed Winston Churchill and the
    aforementioned Liszt. In later years, I remember my dad buying an
    enormous naval ensign Union Jack flag, which was almost as big as the
    house, and hoisting it up a makeshift flag-pole fixed to the wall of our tiny
    council house on each of their birthdays. Family lore tells me that
    terrifyingly I was millimetres away from being named Horatio but,
    according to my father, my mother named me after the actor Jeremy Brett,
    with some mutterings that it was also a nod to Roger Moore’s character,
    Lord Brett Sinclair, from The Persuaders – perhaps some subconscious
    harbinger for future events.
    So there were four of us cramped within the brick and breeze-block
    rooms of this cheap little chip-board house: Blandine, in her dank northfacing bedroom; my mum and dad, penned into their cramped conjugal
    enclave; and me, perched at the edge of the house in a sunny box-room just
    about large enough to contain my child’s single bed and a few threadbare
    toys – a knitted woollen guardsman called Soldier, a grey mouse called
    Mouse and a horrible furry thing that I used to put up my nose called Tivvy,
    which my parents had got from some offer in the TV Times. My art collegeeducated mother painted clouds on the ceiling of my room, and I would lie
    there gazing at them, listening to the gentle sough of the traffic outside
    while my parents’ rows erupted and stormed a few feet away in the next
    room.
    I was a nervous, twitchy, anxious child, prone to bouts of insomnia and
    lonely, terrified hours awake staring at the grotesque faces that the folds at
    the top of the curtains seemed to make. Once the sun rose, I would wait for
    everyone else to wake up, staring for ages from my window at a pair of
    trees growing near the abandoned mushroom factory at the bottom of our
    road. One I called The Mouse and the other I called The Clown, and I
    would gaze transfixed as they swayed and billowed, seemingly locked in
    their immutable dispute, buoyed and buffeted by the eddies and currents of
    the high wind.
    In many ways my upbringing was extremely normal, but at the same time
    strangely atypical in a way as I felt like we never really fitted in. Officially
    we lived in a quaint Sussex village but our house was somewhere the
    tourists never visited; nestled in a scruffy estate on the outskirts and hidden
    well away from the chocolate-box fantasy world of the high street. We were
    dirt poor, existing in penury in a cheap council house, but my parents filled
    it with trappings more akin to the lives of upper-middle-class Hampstead
    intellectuals. Mum’s paintings were everywhere; she devoted her entire
    modest career to detailing the gently rolling Sussex countryside, and the
    walls would be full of her beautiful watercolour landscapes and intricately
    observed natural studies. Where her own work was absent she hung prints
    of Hendrick Avercamp, Vincent Van Gogh and Aubrey Beardsley. She had
    decorated the whole place with strong colours – midnight blues, William
    Morris wallpapers and her own rich velvet homemade curtains in the
    windows. And everywhere, of course, was the deafening torrent of my
    father’s classical music: Wagner, Berlioz, Elgar, Chopin and the ubiquitous,
    inescapable Liszt. My own musical education must have been formed in
    this turbulent crucible, forged by the Ring Cycle and Hungarian Rhapsody,
    hammered into shape like Brünnhilde’s breastplate by dark brooding
    musical landscapes and towering epic melodies. My dad would stand there
    wearing his slippers, his skinny little hairy legs poking out of his red silk
    dressing-gown, ‘conducting’ with his baton, lost in a delicious solipsism
    while his old Phillips reel-to-reel spooled on and on and the rest of us sat
    cowed and mute in the kitchen.
    His was an obsession to end obsessions; he talked about Liszt in
    reverential, quasi-religious tones and even flirted with the idea of ‘taking
    his minor orders’ in homage to Liszt’s later journey of faith – a
    preposterous idea given his status as a confirmed atheist. He was once
    called up for jury service, and after a two-week hiatus returned to reveal
    that when asked to swear on the Bible he had refused and demanded instead
    to do so on a biography of Franz Liszt; something, he said, he really
    believed in.
    In the black and white years of the sixties he cruised around Haywards
    Heath on an old BSA bike with a sidecar clamped on, in which my mother
    would anxiously crouch and perch, fearful of any damage to her hair-do. As
    the family grew he acquired a three-wheeled Robin Reliant, the Sinclair C5
    of its day, drivable with a motorcycle licence: a brittle fibreglass shell on
    wheels offering nominal protection and little dignity. By the time I arrived
    he drove us all around in a tatty, racing-green Morris Traveller, which was
    so decrepit that in September little mushrooms would grow from the rotten
    wooden side-frames. My sister and I would rattle around, seatbelt-less on
    the back seat, singing Abba songs. The car would vibrate worryingly when
    we drove at any speed on the motorway, and if you looked closely you
    could see the road rushing by through little fissures in the floor pan.
    Unbelievably, every couple of years my father would manage to drive it all
    the way to Raiding in Austria on a pilgrimage to Liszt’s birthplace, where
    he would take a small sample of soil from the ground to wear in a phial
    around his neck.
    Living under my father’s roof involved picking your way through a
    complex wilderness of seemingly pointless rules. He once wryly described
    his only indulgences in life as being ‘an ounce of tobacco and a copy of the
    Radio Times’, which he would jealously guard with a Gollum-like grip.
    Woe betide anyone who removed it from its special tartan holder, or got to
    it before he could schedule his listening pleasure with a series of Biroed
    circles, or even more transgressively took it from its home under the small
    wickerwork stool where he liked to place his feet while puffing and
    wheezing endlessly on his ever-present briar pipe. There were other rules
    about the proper time to eat plums and the ‘correct’ way to tie a tie, which
    on reflection don’t quite translate, but at the time seemed narrow and petty,
    always betraying a sense that he was desperately trying to wrest control
    over the moving pieces of his world.
    He was born into a military family and brought up in a depressing
    Haywards Heath council estate called Bentswood: an enclave of identical,
    boxy, nineteen thirties houses cloyed with alcoholism and violence and
    failure, the smell of stale sherry and dog food and the wintery fug of threebar fires. My grandparents’ house was littered with military memorabilia
    like Kukri knives, ornamental ammunition shells and trinkets from India
    where their family had been stationed for the first few years of my father’s
    life. His mother was a frail, high-cheek-boned, bird-like woman, timid and
    browbeaten, and her husband, my dad’s own father, was an abusive, harddrinking soldier who seemed to care for little else but Khan, his enormous
    black Labrador, and who eventually threw his own son out of the house
    because Peter finally managed to stand up to him, unable to inure himself to
    the storm of invidious drunken brutality with which my grandfather ruled
    his pebble-dashed fiefdom. This upbringing left my dad with a legacy of
    absolute physical pacifism towards me, but in his murkier moments
    Larkin’s gloomy prophecy of familial inheritance expressed itself in subtler
    ways. The dank claustrophobia of our doll’s house was often paralleled by
    my father’s capricious moods – the charming, crumpled eccentric
    supplanted by a brooding bully, the climate thick with tension and threat.
    His was a generation that simply wasn’t given the tools to control and
    address its inner ghosts. My father’s black dog slowly gnawed away and
    eventually killed him; a pernicious chain of events leading him towards
    isolation and depression and haemorrhage.
    I must have some distant Scottish heritage, obviously, because of our
    surname, but also because my grandfather was a drummer and bagpipe
    player in the marching band of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He was a distant,
    formal-looking, old-fashioned sort of man with combed-back, oily,
    Macassared hair and a ravaged drinker’s face, who bizarrely was one of the
    few people you will ever hear about who died twice. After a series of
    unforgivable violent, drunken episodes his marriage finally crumbled and
    he staggered off to stay with old army friends or sleep at doss houses. The
    truth is sketchy but he seems to have drifted into a cycle of homelessness
    and extreme alcoholism, so no one was surprised when sometime in the
    nineties, after a long period of estrangement and rumours of nights spent on
    park benches, we were told that he had died – news to which my father
    seemed to react with a strange indifference. At least ten years later,
    however, he received a phone call from some institution asking if he would
    contribute to his father’s funeral. It transpired that he had actually been
    alive all that time: drifting and drinking and spiralling further downwards.
    My dad was never able to forgive him for his reign of domestic terror and
    harboured such bitter hatred towards him that, despite the shock, he refused
    to contribute.
    Although he never physically harmed me, my dad’s brooding rages were
    terrifying and have probably left me with my own legacy of neurosis. He
    could be very controlling – always demanding to know where you were
    going if you left the room. To this day it’s impossible for me to even go for
    a piss without telling my wife. It’s like that scene in The Shawshank
    Redemption when Morgan Freeman’s character gets the job as a bag-packer
    in the supermarket. At other times he could be hugely confrontational and
    would make outrageous or quixotic statements about politics and music.
    When I eventually drifted towards adolescence and began to challenge him,
    we would continually clash in increasingly bitter, cyclical debates over the
    relative merits of pop and classical. Christmas after Christmas would end in
    fraught, charged arguments as we sat glumly at the table in paper hats while
    he passionately but pointlessly tried to prove to me that the Pathétique was
    ‘better’ than ‘Satisfaction’. The experience made me highly opinionated
    about music and probably prepared me wonderfully for a lifetime of overexplaining my own.
    There were lighter moments, of course, too. He could be gentle and kind,
    and sweet and funny and wonderfully anti-materialistic, completely
    unaffected by the eighties climate of crushing ambition, content within his
    tiny kingdom of chip-board and paint. He was surprisingly practical, and
    was always sawing and drilling and gluing and hammering and fixing
    things with his perfectly maintained collection of tools. He made furniture
    and shelves and picture frames for my mother’s paintings, and even his own
    speaker cabinets. One Easter holiday he was working away on what he told
    Blandine and me was a cabinet for his tools. We were puzzled by its need
    for chicken wire until on Easter day we were ushered out to the garden to be
    presented with a beautiful white rabbit each. He’d been building a hutch for
    them.
    The rabbits became a looming presence in our little world. Every
    morning we would traipse over to the wasteland behind the dump by our
    house, and pick them dandelions and choice greenery, and our mum would
    make them a delicious-smelling, warm, mashed-up mealy thing in the
    winter made of oats and potato skins. Blandine even started what she called
    The Rabbit Club, the point of which was vague. The only rules of
    membership seemed to be that as a form of recognition between the
    members (just two – her and me) we would twitch our noses at each other.
    Anyone who knows me well will know that it’s a habit I’ve found hard to
    shake.
    If my father’s obsession was Lizst, my sister’s was Watership Down. She
    read her paperback version so often that the cover disintegrated, and she
    made her own replacement one with a lace and denim trim, and her own
    watercoloured interpretations of Hazel and Fiver et al. She was so keen for
    me to know the story that she actually paid me 2p an hour to listen to her
    read it aloud – a practice that later fed into other authors like Tolkien and
    Rosemary Sutcliffe. I don’t ever remember being read cutesy young kids’
    books, though, and one of my earliest memories is of my mother reading
    me Beowulf. Blandine’s influence on me was huge: she introduced me to
    literature, inspired me to want to be educated, and later played me the pop
    music of the sixties and seventies, which would grow and evolve within me
    and form the second strand of my musical self.
    When I was about six or seven, Blandine and I started going to Sunday
    School. It was a white-brick, single-storey building on the edge of our
    estate run by a frail elderly couple called Mr and Mrs Marsh (my sister
    always joked that they should have lived somewhere called Bog Cottage).
    Anyway, I was far too young to understand any of the real spiritual
    dimensions of what I was signing up for, and looking back I’d have to
    interpret the whole experience as a process of indoctrination to which my
    atheist parents seemed blithely passive. I suppose what attracted me was the
    end-of-year ‘prize-giving’ ceremony where the children were rewarded for
    the number of days they had attended over the year. Depending on how
    many weekly stamps you had accrued, you would be presented with some
    childish bauble or book. Of course, the more ruthless local kids would
    exploit this and turn up just for that day, marching home triumphantly
    brandishing dot-to-dot books or bits of similarly worthless religious tat.
    Our house was at the end of a terrace next door to a kindly, toothless old
    milkman called Bing and his family. Even from a young age, though, I
    sensed a real friction between us and the other families on the estate, most
    of whom I think perceived us as distant and aloof. The unruly boys next
    door would thump and cackle and play heavy metal until late into the
    evening, and there was a coterie of little thugs who would shout abuse at
    my dad and spend all day kicking footballs at the corrugated iron fence
    right outside our house, trampling on my mum’s flowers and cruelly
    shattering her brittle, fictional Edwardian idyll. Indeed, our homemade Arts
    and Crafts-inspired world must have sat uncomfortably with the popular
    Zeitgeist of Status Quo T-shirts and plastic furniture. Our mother made
    most of our clothes so we must have looked very different from the
    corduroyed hordes, and would often be mocked and provoked. I don’t think
    our dad’s growing reputation as Haywards Heath’s answer to Edith Sitwell
    or my mother’s habit of sunbathing nude in the garden really helped, but
    slowly we were accepted and absorbed within the community, although we
    were always seen as outsiders – ‘that lot with the piano in their kitchen’.
    Outside each block of houses there were little grassy spaces where all the
    kids would compete in endless games of football. The estate would be
    ringing with the sounds of play, and tribes of little ruffians would bustle
    around on their Chopper bikes with their threats and their air pistols. Years
    later, whenever I returned, I was always struck by the absence of this; the
    grassy areas mute and childless now the generations had grown, the estate
    left to the greying parents – unwell, divorced and abandoned, like a line
    from ‘North Country Blues’
